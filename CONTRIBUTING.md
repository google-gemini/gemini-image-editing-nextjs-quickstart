## Style Guides

Before you start writing, please familiarize yourself with the technical writing style guide. You don't need to read it all, but do go through the highlights to avoid common feedback.

Additionally, please review the relevant style guide for the language you will be using. These apply strictly to raw code files (e.g., `*.ts`, `*.js`, `*.css`), but code snippets in documentation tend to favor readability over strict adherence.


## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** - React framework for the web application
- **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash** - AI model for image generation and editing
- **shadcn/ui** - Re-usable components built using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS
